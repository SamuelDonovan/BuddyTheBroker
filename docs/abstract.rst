Abstract
========

Each year thousands of hedge funds and brokerages with armies of some of the most educated
individuals in finance each compete to make money in the stock market. These individuals comb
through heaps of data using some of the most complex strategies and spend countless hours in an
attempt to beat the market by even a couple percentage points. These individuals will now have a new
competitor on the horizon; the goal of my project is to put Wall Street's best and brightest up against
my cat, Buddy.

Each day, with the help of an embedded system to communicate his stock picks Buddy will go
paw to toe with investors and traders the world over. When presented with a variety of stock tickers
Buddy will be able to buy/sell stocks on the open market.
